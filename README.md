# CDDA IV

The [Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](http://en.cataclysmdda.com/) Issue Voting Machine.

You can see the official instance running [here](http://iv.cataclysmdda.com:8111/all).

This is initial code upload. Things are messy. Beware of crappy code, and even crappier templates.

0.9.x version space is for bugfixes. If it runs with some load for a month without anything breaking/new bugs spotted it'll move to 1.0.

**Love needed here:**

- Test cases (any, and all)
- Code clean up
- Templates clean up
- Docs (YARD)

The current front-end is zero-JavaScript, which makes it archaic/old-school. If you're comfortable with modern JS frameworks please contact me. I can write you a decent JSON API so together we can make this thing *shine*.

## Contributing

Follow the usual GitHub development model:

1. Clone the repository
2. Make your changes on a separate branch
3. Make a pull request

**NOTE**: I'll accept tests only if they use MiniTest, unless you somehow manage to convince me your choice is better.

## Contact

You can find me on FreeNode and IRCNet, finding my e-mail should be a no-brainer.

## Licensing

Standard two-clause BSD license, see LICENSE.txt for details.
