# CDDA IV

The [Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](http://en.cataclysmdda.com/) Issue Voting Machine.

You can see the official instance running [here](http://iv.cataclysmdda.com:8111/all).

**Love needed here:**

- Test cases (any, and all)
- Code clean up
- Templates clean up
- Docs (YARD)

Starting with 1.1 voting is by default over AJAX, and so requires JavaScript. The old behaviour is still available.

## Contributing

Follow the usual GitHub development model:

1. Clone the repository
2. Make your changes on a separate branch
3. Make a pull request

**NOTE**: I'll accept tests only if they use MiniTest, unless you somehow manage to convince me your choice is better.

## Contact

You can find me on FreeNode and IRCNet, finding my e-mail should be a no-brainer.

## Licensing

Standard two-clause BSD license, see LICENSE.txt for details.
